These files can be generated from your current changes or from a specific commit.\nPatches are useful in the following situations:\nYou’ve explained something to someone while screen-sharing, and you want to share the code without rewriting everything in another environment. You have changes that another developer needs to continue working on a task, but you need to finish something before opening a new pull request. Sharing these changes allows your coworker to use your code without delay. A coworker has been assigned to a project you previously worked on, so you want to share some code to help them get started. You want to save some code for future reference but don’t want to lose it in your long stash list. Creating a patch # Creating a patch is really easy.\nFrom changes in your working directory # You can create a patch by using the output of the git diff command:\ngit diff \u0026gt; some_changes_i_want_to_share.patch\nYou can also add specific files from your working directory to a patch:\ngit diff file1.js \u0026gt; some_changes.patch\ngit diff file1.js file2.js \u0026gt; some_changes.patch\nFrom changes in a commit # You can save the changes from a commit using git format-patch:\ngit format-patch [commit_hash]\nThe .patch file # You can open the .patch file in your code editor or IDE like any other file to view the code and metadata stored in it. This allows you to verify if you’re saving what you intended.\nApplying the patch # To apply the patch, simply use the command:\ngit apply my_patch_file.patch\nWhen you run git apply, the changes will be applied to your working directory. Applying a patch doesn’t create a new commit.\nConclusion # Patches are easy to understand and use, and they’re highly useful when collaborating with other developers or saving code for future reference. Try to make the most of them to improve your workflow.\n","date":"2 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-personal-blog/posts/git-patches/git-patches/","section":"Posts","summary":"How to use git patches to store changes and share them.","title":"Git patches","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"2 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-personal-blog/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"2 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-personal-blog/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-personal-blog/tags/technical/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Technical","type":"tags"},{"content":"One of the things I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to do is start a blog (and this is not my first attempt). I’ve started about three different blogs where I only published a few posts and then never wrote in them again.\nThe purpose of this blog is to share my ideas, knowledge, and anything I find interesting. I really enjoy sharing with people; it\u0026rsquo;s something very fulfilling for me.\nThis idea of sharing knowledge and ideas with the world started a few years ago when I was giving private lessons to students at a small IT school in my hometown. There were very curious students who asked me about different topics that I liked, and I felt really good explaining to them what I thought and what I knew.\nOver time, these students have grown up, and since we all live in a small town, it’s very common to see them around. After several years, some still come to me asking about things we used to talk about back then or with new questions. I realized that sharing can be beneficial for people.\nI have also had the opportunity to give several technical talks about some technologies to students at a couple of universities that I’m in contact with. I’ve noticed how teaching them sparks curiosity about what they’re learning. It makes me very happy to see that I can add something to their learning, even if it’s small.\nSince then, I like to think that what I have to share interests some people, that they can learn something from what I know, something they find valuable, and that they get to know my opinions.\nYou lose nothing by sharing; on the contrary, it’s better to enjoy doing it.\n","date":"31 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-personal-blog/posts/i-started-again/i-started-again/","section":"Posts","summary":"First post to start this blog.","title":"I started... again","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"31 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-personal-blog/categories/misc/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Misc","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"31 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-personal-blog/tags/personal/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Personal","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-personal-blog/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-personal-blog/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
