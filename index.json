I’ve started about three different blogs where I only published a few posts and then never wrote in them again.\nThe purpose of this blog is to share my ideas, knowledge, and anything I find interesting. I really enjoy sharing with people; it\u0026rsquo;s something very fulfilling for me.\nThis idea of sharing knowledge and ideas with the world started a few years ago when I was giving private lessons to students at a small IT school in my hometown. There were very curious students who asked me about different topics that I liked, and I felt really good explaining to them what I thought and what I knew.\nOver time, these students have grown up, and since we all live in a small town, it’s very common to see them around. After several years, some still come to me asking about things we used to talk about back then or with new questions. I realized that sharing can be beneficial for people.\nI have also had the opportunity to give several technical talks about some technologies to students at a couple of universities that I’m in contact with. I’ve noticed how teaching them sparks curiosity about what they’re learning. It makes me very happy to see that I can add something to their learning, even if it’s small.\nSince then, I like to think that what I have to share interests some people, that they can learn something from what I know, something they find valuable, and that they get to know my opinions.\nYou lose nothing by sharing; on the contrary, it’s better to enjoy doing it.\n","date":"31 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-personal-blog/posts/i-started-again/i-started-again/","section":"Posts","summary":"First post to start this blog.","title":"I started... again","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"31 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-personal-blog/categories/misc/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Misc","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"31 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-personal-blog/tags/personal/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Personal","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"31 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-personal-blog/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"31 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-personal-blog/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-personal-blog/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/my-personal-blog/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
